First try on MP Charts library

What it does now
1. It graphs a column chart of hardcoded data. It includes a set of three colors to choose from
2. It includes animations for all the columns in both axis

TODO
1. Get a JSON file from Geist and parse it in order to get a data sets more complicated 
2. Add the three colors and choose whether to use one or other
3. Add more graphics like pie or others
4. Add fragment support so you can switch between charts. Reload only if is needed
5. Know how to add more styles to the charts
6. Try to keep the same styles, mood and feeling between charts
